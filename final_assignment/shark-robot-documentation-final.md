# Spaceship Shark Robot

## Introduction
After exploring servos and sensors, I wanted to learn how to build a vehicle that moves and detects objects and responds based on the object detection.
So I started sketching two different ways for the vehicle to trigger the responses.

### Sketch 1: 
![Car Sensor](https://github.com/1andreh/-SP24-IXD256-AndrewHuang/assets/158603689/6a924351-e02c-40b5-8df2-89248edfedfb)
I ended up following this concept of having two servoe as front wheels with a rolling backwheel to establish minimal space while achieving the vehicle to move forward, backwards, turn right, and left. I also ended up implementing the sensors, since I want the vehicle to have some sort of response when detecting an object. My first sensor I explored was the light sensor, however, I ended up using a distance sensor because there are many objects around the environment of a room, having the robot respond around the objects in the room was found to be more practical than detecting light.

### Sketch 2: 
![Car Dance](https://github.com/1andreh/-SP24-IXD256-AndrewHuang/assets/158603689/7ce1c037-4a1d-41da-a4b7-354855bf3f4f)
I wanted the robot to dance in a sequence to learn how to control the robot vehicle direction.

Provide a description of your initial project idea and include images of the concept sketches that you created in Part 1 of this assignment.
Explain the reasoning behind your final choice of the project concept, whether itâ€™s based on one of the initial sketches, a combination of or a departure from the original concepts.
