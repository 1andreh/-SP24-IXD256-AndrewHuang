## Digital Level

The Digital Level is meant to help tool builders and wood working hobbiests measure precisely on the angle of measurement. By using the ESP32 acceleration on the x axis, it is able to calculate the angle of measurement. Because the acceleration (angle controller) value is from -1 to 1, I used the map function to map the values from -1, 1 to -90, 90 degrees, making it easily readable to wood workers on identifying the degree that the object is tilted. Since the display is small and hard to read, other workers may want to see the degree of angles. That's why I implemented a LED stick display each LED light on every 15 degree increments, allowing workers from a distance to analyze the object's degree of measurement. Fun features include using the ANGLE to change the default color of the idle. When the ESP32 detects motion, the LED colors will turn green. By using states in parts of the code, I was able to achieve the two different states i.e. 'IDLE' and 'MOTION'. On 'MOTION', the LED lights will turn green, representing motion.
