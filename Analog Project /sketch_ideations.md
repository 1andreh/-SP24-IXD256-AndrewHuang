## Digital Level
**Input #1)** IMU - Uses motion gyroscope rotation to detect stability of the surface. 
**Output #1)** Display - A display of degrees of the current tilted position. 
**Output #2)** LED - Outputs a new LED every 15 degrees of tilt. This overall helps determine how stable or flat a surface. The motion rotation is mapped to the LED to turn on each LED light every 15 degrees.

## Digital Canvas Art
**Input #1)** IMU - Detects movement of the ESP32 which is mapped to the computer draw strokes onto the canvas.
**Input #2)** Potentiometer mapped with the computer to control the thickness of the line strokes.
**Output #1)** Strokes - Outputs strokes and paths that is detecting the movement of the ESP32 for drawing.
**Output #2)** Stroke Thickness - Stroke thickness is controlled by the potentiometer.
