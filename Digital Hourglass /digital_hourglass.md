## Digital Hourglass

The digital hourglass is to encourage the young generation to read daily. With the Digital Hourglass, kids of all age are able to use a bookmark to keep track of where they left of in the book. When picking the book back up to read, they can simply place the bookmark onto the puzzle piece to start the timer. The ESP32 display will start to generate different shades of blue circles for approx. 15 minutes until the screen fills up entirely. If the users need to use a restroom break, taking the bookmark off the puzzle piece will place the ESP32 display at a "Resting" mode, which will not generate blue circles (pausing the timer). Users have the option to use to quick read mode by simply pressing the button on the display, which speeds up the generation of the blue circles, which results in an approx. 10 min timer.
